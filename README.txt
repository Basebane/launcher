The Basebane Launcher

What is it?
The basebane launcher is an open source* launcher for Basebane!

Advantages:
- It helps keep all your versions of Basebane! organised
- Limits one Basebane! executable to run at a time and minimises corrupt game directories
- Allows any future features we want to add such as authentication and the ability to mod the game

NOTICES ABOUT BASEBANE LAUNCHER v0.01:
- The "Manage Releases" window is unfinished and is rather buggy (it can sometimes randomly crash the program). We hope to provide a stable and finished release manager in the next update

*The Basebane Launcher is open source, which means that you can look at the code and modify it to create your own version of the Basebane Launcher. However, you must make any modifications you do open source too.
